# cppday-webrtc

Slides and sample code for "Realtime Communication with WebRTC in C++" presentation
at [C++ Day 2020 by Italian C++ Community](https://www.italiancpp.org/cppday20-talks/).


## Examples

Sample code in src/examples directory is meant to be copied in webrtc/src/examples of a
google webrtc source code checkout.

cppday and cppday_snipeets targets (just those, not the whole file) inside src/BUILD.gn
are to be integrated into existing webrtc/src/BUILD.gn file.
